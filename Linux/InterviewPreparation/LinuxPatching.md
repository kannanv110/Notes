Linux patching interview questions often focus on understanding the process, tools, and best practices for applying updates and security patches to a Linux system. Key areas include identifying vulnerability types, applying updates using package managers, and troubleshooting post-patching issues. [1]  
Common Interview Questions and Answers: [1]  
1.  What is the purpose of patching a Linux system? [1]  

• Answer: Patching a Linux system applies security updates and bug fixes to address vulnerabilities, enhance system stability, and improve overall performance. [1]  

2.  How do you identify which packages need to be updated on a Linux system? [1, 2]  

• Answer: Use package managers like yum, apt, or dnf to check for available updates and identify systems requiring updates. [1, 2]  

3.  Describe the process of applying a security patch to a Linux system. [1, 2]  

• Answer: The process typically involves downloading the patch, verifying its integrity, applying it using the appropriate package manager, and rebooting the system (if necessary). [1, 2]  

4.  What tools are used for patching a Linux system? [1, 2]  

• Answer: Package managers (e.g., yum, apt, dnf), security scanners, and vulnerability management tools are used. [1, 2]  

5.  What are the potential impacts of not applying patches? [1]  

• Answer: Not applying patches can leave systems vulnerable to security exploits, lead to instability, and potentially cause data breaches or service outages. [1]  

6.  How do you verify that a patch has been applied successfully? [1, 2]  

• Answer: Verify by checking the version of the updated package using the package manager, examining system logs, and testing functionality to ensure no issues arose. [1, 2]  

7.  What should you do if a patch installation fails or causes issues? [1, 2]  

• Answer: First, examine system logs, research known issues with the patch, and consider rolling back to a previous version if necessary. [1, 2]  

8.  How do you handle situations where a patch might break a specific application or service? [1, 2]  

• Answer: Prioritize critical services, research the patch's impact, and consider delaying the update, using a testing environment, or using workarounds until a stable patch is available. [1, 2]  

9.  What are the best practices for patching a Linux system? [1, 2]  

• Answer: Use a systematic approach, automate patching when possible, implement a patching schedule, and test patches in a non-production environment before deploying them to production systems. [1, 2]  

10. How do you handle patching on a production server without downtime? [1]  

• Answer: Use techniques like hotfixes, rolling updates, and patching services that allow applications to continue running during the update process. [1]  

11. Explain the differences between security patches and kernel updates. [1]  

• Answer: Security patches address specific vulnerabilities, while kernel updates often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. [1]
