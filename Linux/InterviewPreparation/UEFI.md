UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) offers several advantages over the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) during the booting process:

1. Faster Boot Times:

UEFI can significantly reduce boot times compared to BIOS. It initializes hardware components in parallel rather than sequentially.
It can directly boot the OS loader from the ESP (EFI System Partition) without relying on a Master Boot Record (MBR).
Support for faster storage technologies like NVMe also contributes to quicker boot speeds.
2. Enhanced Security:

Secure Boot: A key UEFI feature that verifies the digital signatures of the bootloader, operating system, and firmware components. This prevents unauthorized or malicious software from loading during startup, protecting against bootkits and rootkits.
UEFI offers a safer way to manage the Master Boot Record, reducing vulnerabilities.
It can integrate with hardware-based security technologies like TPM (Trusted Platform Module).
3. Support for Larger Storage Devices:

BIOS is limited to addressing storage devices up to 2.2 TB and using the MBR partitioning scheme, which restricts the number of primary partitions.
UEFI supports the GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning scheme, allowing for disk sizes beyond 2.2 TB (theoretically up to 9.4 zettabytes) and a greater number of primary partitions (up to 128 in Windows).
4. More Flexible and Feature-Rich Pre-OS Environment:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Many UEFI implementations provide a user-friendly GUI with mouse support, making it easier to navigate and configure system settings compared to the text-based interface of BIOS.
Networking Capabilities: Some UEFI implementations offer network support even before the operating system loads, enabling features like remote diagnostics and firmware updates.
UEFI Shell: Provides a command-line interface for advanced users and troubleshooting.
Pre-boot Applications: UEFI can run independent applications for diagnostics, system recovery, and more, before the OS starts.
Multilingual Support: UEFI can display information in multiple languages.
5. Modern Hardware Support:

UEFI is designed to support modern hardware architectures, including 64-bit systems, multi-core processors, and newer peripherals, offering better compatibility and performance than the older 16-bit BIOS.
It efficiently handles the initialization of multiple hardware devices during boot.
6. Extensibility and Modularity:

UEFI has a modular design, allowing vendors to add or update modules and drivers to extend its functionality and support specific hardware.
7. Platform and Architecture Independence:

While most commonly associated with x86/x64 architectures, UEFI also supports other architectures like ARM and PowerPC, offering a more consistent firmware experience across different platforms.
In summary, UEFI provides a more modern, secure, and flexible booting environment compared to legacy BIOS, offering advantages in speed, security, storage support, user interface, and compatibility with contemporary hardware.
