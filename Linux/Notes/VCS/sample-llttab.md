# LLT Configuration Table for VCS Cluster

# Define the local node's hostname and a unique node ID within the cluster.
# The hostname MUST match the first field in /etc/llthosts on this node.
# The node ID MUST be unique across the cluster (typically starting from 0).
set-node node1 0

# Define the cluster ID. This must be the same on all nodes in the cluster.
set-cluster 100

# Define the first LLT link.
# <link-name>: A logical name for the link (e.g., link0). Must be consistent across nodes for the same physical link.
# <device>: The network interface to use for this link (must match the order and device in /etc/llthosts).
# -peer <hostname>: The hostname of the peer node connected via this link (from /etc/llthosts).

link link0 eth0 -peer node2
link link0 eth0 -peer node3
link link0 eth0 -peer node4

# Define the second LLT link (for redundancy).
link link1 eth1 -peer node2
link link1 eth1 -peer node3
link link1 eth1 -peer node4

# Explanation:

# set-node node1 0:
#   - set-node: Keyword to define the local node.
#   - node1: The hostname of this specific node. This *must* match the hostname in the first column of /etc/llthosts on this node.
#   - 0: The unique node ID for this node within the VCS cluster. Node IDs are typically sequential starting from 0 (node1=0, node2=1, node3=2, etc.). This ID is used internally by LLT.

# set-cluster 100:
#   - set-cluster: Keyword to define the cluster ID.
#   - 100: A unique identifier for this VCS cluster. This *must* be the same integer on all nodes participating in the cluster.

# link link0 eth0 -peer node2
# link link0 eth0 -peer node3
# link link0 eth0 -peer node4
#   - link: Keyword to define an LLT link.
#   - link0: A logical name for this first LLT link. It's common to use sequential names (link0, link1, etc.). The name itself doesn't have to be the same across nodes, but the *order* and the corresponding physical device *must* align with /etc/llthosts.
#   - eth0: The network interface on the local node that this link uses. This *must* correspond to the order of devices listed for this node in /etc/llthosts.
#   - -peer: Keyword to specify the peer node connected via this link.
#   - node2, node3, node4: The hostnames of the other nodes in the cluster (as defined in /etc/llthosts). For a fully connected private network, each link on the local node will have a -peer entry for every other node in the cluster.

# link link1 eth1 -peer node2
# link link1 eth1 -peer node3
# link link1 eth1 -peer node4
#   - This defines a second redundant LLT link using the 'eth1' interface on the local node, connecting to the 'eth1' interfaces of the other cluster nodes.

# Important Considerations for /etc/llttab in VCS:

# Consistency: The /etc/llttab file *must* be configured correctly on each node, reflecting its own hostname, unique node ID, the cluster ID, and the links to all other peer nodes.

# Node ID Uniqueness: Ensure that each node in the cluster has a unique node ID. Conflicts in node IDs will prevent LLT from functioning correctly.

# Cluster ID Consistency: The cluster ID must be identical on all nodes that are part of the same VCS cluster.

# Link Definition and /etc/llthosts Alignment: The order of 'link' entries and the devices specified within them *must* correspond to the order of devices listed for the local node in /etc/llthosts. The '-peer' hostnames should refer to the other nodes in the cluster as defined in /etc/llthosts.

# Fully Connected Private Network: The example assumes a fully connected private network where each node can directly communicate with every other node over the LLT links.

# Number of Links: Defining multiple LLT links (redundancy) is highly recommended for a stable VCS cluster.

# Private Network: The network interfaces used for LLT should be on a private, dedicated network segment.

**In summary, /etc/llttab defines the local node's identity within the VCS cluster (hostname and node ID), the cluster's unique ID, and the configuration of the LLT links, specifying the local network interfaces and the peer nodes they connect to. Accurate and consistent configuration across all cluster nodes is essential for LLT to establish reliable inter-node communication, which is the foundation of a functioning VCS cluster.**
