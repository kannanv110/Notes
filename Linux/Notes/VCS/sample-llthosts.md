node2         0             eth0:1000                  eth1
node3         0             eth0:1000                  eth1
node4         0             eth0:1000                  eth1

# Explanation:

# node1, node2, node3, node4: These are the hostnames of the nodes in the VCS cluster.
#                            Ensure these names resolve correctly via DNS or /etc/hosts.

# 0: This is the network-id. In a single cluster, this is typically '0'.
#    For multiple LLT networks on the same set of nodes, you would use different IDs.

# eth0:1000: This defines the first LLT link using the network interface 'eth0'.
#           The ':1000' optionally specifies the link speed in Mbps (here, 1000 Mbps or Gigabit Ethernet).
#           If the speed is not specified, LLT attempts to auto-detect it.

# eth1: This defines the second LLT link using the network interface 'eth1'.
#       No speed is explicitly specified, so LLT will attempt auto-detection.

# Important Considerations for /etc/llthosts in VCS:

# Consistency: The /etc/llthosts file *must* be identical on all nodes in the VCS cluster.
#              The hostname order and the defined links must be the same.

# Hostname Resolution: Ensure that the hostnames listed in this file can be resolved to the correct IP addresses on all cluster nodes. This can be done through DNS or by having consistent entries in the /etc/hosts file on each node.

# Network IDs: For a standard single VCS cluster, the network-id is usually '0'. If you have multiple independent LLT networks for different purposes on the same hardware, you would use different network-ids (e.g., '0', '1', '2').

# Link Devices: Specify the actual network interface names that LLT will use for inter-node communication. These interfaces should be dedicated to the private VCS interconnect and should be reliable and low-latency.

# Link Speed (Optional): Specifying the link speed can be helpful but is often auto-detected. Ensure the specified speed matches the actual link speed.

# Multiple Links: Defining multiple LLT links (as shown with eth0 and eth1) provides redundancy for the private cluster interconnect. If one link fails, LLT can continue communication over the other links, enhancing cluster stability.

# Private Network: The network interfaces used for LLT should be on a private, dedicated network segment that is not routable outside the cluster. This enhances security and prevents interference with public network traffic.

# Example with Different Network IDs (Less Common for a Single Cluster):

# node1         0             eth0
# node2         0             eth0
# node1         1             bond0:1000
# node2         1             bond0:1000

# In this less common scenario, node1 and node2 would have two separate LLT networks configured.

**In summary, the /etc/llthosts file in a VCS cluster defines the participating nodes, the LLT network identifier, and the network interfaces that LLT will use for private inter-node communication. Maintaining consistency across all nodes is paramount for a stable VCS cluster.**
