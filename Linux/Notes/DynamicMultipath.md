You're asking about the configuration file and commands related to **Device Mapper Multipathing (DM-Multipath)** in Linux, which is the standard way to handle multipathing for storage devices. This is independent of LVM, although you often use multipathed devices as the Physical Volumes for LVM.

Here's a breakdown of the configuration file and essential commands:

**Configuration File: `/etc/multipath.conf`**

This is the primary configuration file for the `multipathd` daemon and the `multipath` command. If this file doesn't exist, multipath will use built-in default settings. You typically create or modify this file to customize multipathing behavior.

The file is organized into the following sections:

* **`defaults`**: Defines default values for various multipath parameters. These settings apply globally unless overridden in other sections. Common parameters include:
    * `user_friendly_names`: If set to `yes`, uses aliases like `mpath0`, `mpath1` instead of WWIDs for multipath device names.
    * `polling_interval`: The interval (in seconds) at which paths are checked for availability.
    * `path_selector`: The algorithm used to select a path for I/O (e.g., `round-robin`, `queue-length`).
    * `path_grouping_policy`: How paths are grouped (e.g., `failover`, `multibus`, `group_by_serial`).
    * `failback`: Specifies the failback policy (e.g., `immediate`, `manual`).
    * `no_path_retry`: Defines how many times to retry a failed path before disabling queueing.
    * `bindings_file`: The location of the file that stores the persistent names for multipath devices when `user_friendly_names` is `yes`.
    * `wwids_file`: The location of the file that keeps track of the WWIDs of created multipath devices.

* **`blacklist`**: Lists devices that should *not* be considered for multipathing. You can blacklist by:
    * `devnode`: Using regular expressions to match device node names (e.g., `"^sd[a-z]$"` to blacklist local SCSI disks).
    * `wwid`: By the World Wide Identifier of the device.
    * `device`: By vendor and product information.

* **`blacklist_exceptions`**: Lists devices that *should* be considered for multipathing even if they match a rule in the `blacklist` section. You can specify exceptions by `devnode`, `wwid`, or `device`.

* **`multipaths`**: Defines specific configurations for individual multipath devices based on their WWID. Settings in this section override those in `defaults` and `devices`. You can set attributes like `alias` (the user-friendly name), `path_selector`, `path_grouping_policy`, `prio` (path priority), and more.

* **`devices`**: Defines settings for specific storage controller types (identified by vendor and product). These settings override the `defaults` section for devices matching the specified vendor and product. You can configure parameters like `path_selector`, `path_grouping_policy`, `prio_callout` (an external program to determine path priority), `hardware_handler`, and vendor-specific parameters.

**Example `/etc/multipath.conf` (minimal but common):**

```
defaults {
        user_friendly_names yes
}

blacklist {
        devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
        devnode "^hd[a-z]"
        devnode "^vd[a-z]"
}

multipaths {
        wwid 3600a0b80001234567890abcdef01234 :
                alias storage_array_lun1
                path_selector "round-robin 0"
                path_grouping_policy multibus
}

devices {
        vendor "HP" {
                product "MSA2000sa" {
                        path_grouping_policy group_by_prio
                        prio "alua"
                        path_selector "round-robin 0"
                        failback immediate
                        no_path_retry 5
                }
        }
        vendor "IBM" {
                product "2145" {
                        path_grouping_policy "group_by_prio"
                        prio "alua"
                        failback "followover"
                        rr_min_io 1
                }
        }
}
```

**Key Multipathing Commands:**

* **`multipath`**: This is the main command-line tool to manage multipath devices.
    * **`sudo multipath -ll`**: Shows the current multipath topology in detail, including multipath device names, WWIDs, paths, states, and policies.
    * **`sudo multipath -l`**: Shows a more concise view of the multipath topology.
    * **`sudo multipath -v<n>`**: Controls the verbosity level (0 for no output, 1 for created/updated device names, 2 for all detected paths/multipaths/maps).
    * **`sudo multipath -f <device_name>`**: Forces the removal of a specific multipath device.
    * **`sudo multipath -F`**: Forces the removal of all multipath devices.
    * **`sudo multipath -w <wwid>`** or **`sudo multipath -w <devnode>`**: Adds a device to the blacklist.
    * **`sudo multipath -W <wwid>`** or **`sudo multipath -W <devnode>`**: Removes a device from the blacklist.
    * **`sudo multipath -u`**: Updates the multipath device names based on the `multipath.conf` file.
    * **`sudo multipath -d`**: Kills the `multipathd` daemon (usually not recommended).
    * **`sudo multipath -r`**: Reconfigures and reloads the multipath maps based on the current `multipath.conf`.

* **`multipathd`**: This is the multipath daemon that runs in the background and monitors the paths.
    * **`sudo systemctl start multipathd`** or **`sudo service multipathd start`**: Starts the daemon.
    * **`sudo systemctl stop multipathd`** or **`sudo service multipathd stop`**: Stops the daemon.
    * **`sudo systemctl restart multipathd`** or **`sudo service multipathd restart`**: Restarts the daemon.
    * **`sudo systemctl enable multipathd`**: Enables the daemon to start at boot.
    * **`sudo systemctl status multipathd`** or **`sudo service multipathd status`**: Shows the status of the daemon.
    * **`sudo multipathd -k`**: Enters an interactive console for `multipathd` where you can issue commands like `show config`, `reconfigure`, `show paths`.

* **`kpartx`**: This command is used to create device maps for partitions on multipath devices. It's often automatically invoked by `multipathd` but can be used manually if needed, especially for DOS partition tables.
    * **`sudo kpartx -av /dev/mapper/<mpath_device>`**: Adds partition mappings for the specified multipath device.
    * **`sudo kpartx -dv /dev/mapper/<mpath_device>`**: Deletes partition mappings.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Install `multipath-tools`**: Ensure the necessary package is installed (`sudo apt-get install multipath-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo yum install device-mapper-multipath` on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora).
2.  **Configure `/etc/multipath.conf`**: Edit the configuration file according to your storage array vendor's recommendations and your desired settings. Pay close attention to the `blacklist` and `devices` sections.
3.  **Start/Enable `multipathd`**: Start the multipath daemon and enable it to start on boot.
4.  **Discover Multipath Devices**: The `multipathd` daemon will automatically discover and create multipath devices based on your configuration. Use `multipath -ll` to verify.
5.  **Use Multipath Devices**: You can now use the `/dev/mapper/mpath*` devices (or the user-friendly names if enabled) as the underlying block devices for LVM Physical Volumes, file systems, etc.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Storage Vendor Documentation:** Always consult your storage array vendor's documentation for recommended multipath configurations and best practices. They often provide specific settings for the `devices` section of `multipath.conf`.
* **Kernel Support:** Ensure your Linux kernel has the Device Mapper Multipath module (`dm_multipath`) enabled.
* **Initramfs Update:** After modifying `/etc/multipath.conf`, it's often necessary to rebuild your initramfs image so that multipathing is configured early during the boot process, especially if you are booting from SAN. Use commands like `sudo update-initramfs -u -k all` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dracut --force` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora).
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your multipath configuration after making changes to ensure failover and load balancing are working as expected.

By understanding the `/etc/multipath.conf` file and the `multipath` and `multipathd` commands, you can effectively configure and manage dynamic multipathing in your Linux environment for improved storage resilience and performance.
