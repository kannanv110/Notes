Configuring network bonding on Linux by editing configuration files typically involves modifying network configuration files specific to your Linux distribution. Here's a breakdown of the process for common distributions:

**Important Notes:**

* **Backup:** Always back up your network configuration files before making any changes. Incorrect configurations can lead to network connectivity issues.
* **Root Privileges:** You'll need root privileges (using `sudo`) to edit these files.
* **NetworkManager:** If your system uses NetworkManager (common on desktop-oriented distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu Desktop, etc.), it might be easier and more recommended to use `nmcli` or GUI tools to manage network bonding. Directly editing configuration files might conflict with NetworkManager's management. If you choose to edit files, you might need to tell NetworkManager to unmanage the involved interfaces or use a specific configuration method.
* **Distribution-Specific:** The exact file paths and syntax can vary slightly between different Linux distributions and even versions.

Here's how to configure bonding for common distributions:

**1. Debian/Ubuntu (without NetworkManager managing the interfaces):**

* **File to Edit:** `/etc/network/interfaces`

* **Example Configuration:**

    ```
    # The primary network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    # Define the bond interface
    auto bond0
    iface bond0 inet dhcp
        bond-slaves eth0 eth1
        bond-mode active-backup
        bond-miimon 100

    # If you want a static IP for the bond interface:
    # auto bond0
    # iface bond0 inet static
    #     address 192.168.1.100
    #     netmask 255.255.255.0
    #     gateway 192.168.1.1
    #     bond-slaves eth0 eth1
    #     bond-mode active-backup
    #     bond-miimon 100
    #     bond-primary eth0  # Optional: Specify the primary active interface

    # Configure the physical interfaces as slaves
    iface eth0 inet manual
        bond-master bond0

    iface eth1 inet manual
        bond-master bond0
    ```

    * `auto bond0`: Enables the `bond0` interface to be brought up at boot.
    * `iface bond0 inet dhcp` or `iface bond0 inet static`: Configures the IP addressing for the bond interface.
    * `bond-slaves eth0 eth1`: Specifies the physical interfaces that will be part of the bond.
    * `bond-mode <mode>`: Sets the bonding mode (e.g., `active-backup`, `balance-rr`, `balance-xor`, `broadcast`, `balance-tlb`, `balance-alb`).
    * `bond-miimon <milliseconds>`: Sets the link monitoring interval in milliseconds.
    * `bond-primary <interface>`: (Optional in `active-backup`) Specifies the primary active interface.
    * `iface eth0 inet manual` and `iface eth1 inet manual`: Configure the physical interfaces to be managed by the `bond0` interface. They should not have their own IP addresses configured here.
    * `bond-master bond0`: Assigns the physical interfaces as slaves to the `bond0` master interface.

* **Apply Changes:**

    ```bash
    sudo ifdown eth0
    sudo ifdown eth1
    sudo ifdown bond0
    sudo ifup bond0
    ```

    Or, you can restart the networking service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

**2. Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora (without NetworkManager managing the interfaces):**

* **Configuration Files:** You'll typically create or modify interface configuration files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`.

* **Create the Bond Interface Configuration (`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0`):**

    ```
    DEVICE=bond0
    NAME=bond0
    TYPE=Bond
    BONDING_MASTER=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp  # Or static
    ONBOOT=yes

    # If using static IP:
    # BOOTPROTO=static
    # IPADDR=192.168.1.100
    # NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    # GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
    # DNS1=8.8.8.8
    # DNS2=8.8.4.4

    BONDING_OPTS="mode=active-backup miimon=100"
    ```

    * `DEVICE=bond0`: Defines the name of the bond interface.
    * `TYPE=Bond`: Specifies the interface type as bonding.
    * `BONDING_MASTER=yes`: Indicates this is the master bonding interface.
    * `BOOTPROTO=dhcp` or `BOOTPROTO=static`: Configures IP addressing.
    * `ONBOOT=yes`: Enables the interface to be brought up at boot.
    * `BONDING_OPTS`: Contains the bonding mode and other options.

* **Configure the Slave Interface Configurations (`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` and `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`):**

    For each slave interface (e.g., `eth0`, `eth1`):

    ```
    DEVICE=eth0
    NAME=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    MASTER=bond0
    SLAVE=yes
    ```

    Modify the `DEVICE` and `NAME` accordingly for each slave interface.

* **Apply Changes:**

    ```bash
    sudo ifdown eth0
    sudo ifdown eth1
    sudo ifdown bond0
    sudo ifup bond0
    ```

    Or, restart the network service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart network
    ```

**3. Using NetworkManager (if you choose to configure bonding via files):**

If you want to configure bonding via files while using NetworkManager, you need to create connection profiles that NetworkManager can understand.

* **Create a Bond Connection Profile (`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/bond0.nmconnection`):**

    ```ini
    [connection]
    id=bond0
    uuid=<generate_a_uuid>  # Use 'uuidgen' to create a unique UUID
    type=bond
    interface-name=bond0
    autoconnect=true

    [bond]
    mode=active-backup
    miimon=100

    [ipv4]
    method=auto  # Or manual
    # address1=192.168.1.100/24,192.168.1.1
    # dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
    # routes1=192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.1 0

    [ipv6]
    method=ignore  # Or auto

    [master]
    slaves=eth0,eth1
    ```

* **Ensure Slave Interfaces are Managed by the Bond Profile:** The slave interfaces themselves should not have their own full connection profiles with IP addresses. NetworkManager will manage them as part of the bond. You might need to ensure any existing connection profiles for `eth0` and `eth1` don't have IP configurations and are set as slaves. You can achieve this by creating or modifying their `.nmconnection` files:

    ```ini
    [connection]
    id=eth0
    uuid=<generate_a_uuid>
    type=ethernet
    interface-name=eth0
    master=bond0
    slave-type=bond
    autoconnect-slaves=1

    [ipv4]
    method=disabled

    [ipv6]
    method=disabled
    ```

    Do the same for `eth1`, generating a different UUID.

* **Apply Changes:**

    ```bash
    sudo nmcli connection reload
    sudo nmcli connection up bond0
    ```

**Verification:**

After configuring bonding, you can verify its status using:

```bash
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
ip addr show bond0
```

The output of `/proc/net/bonding/bond0` will show the bonding mode, the active and inactive slaves, and their status. `ip addr show bond0` will display the IP address assigned to the bond interface.

Remember to choose the configuration method that aligns with your system's network management (traditional init scripts or NetworkManager) and your distribution's conventions. If you're unsure, using NetworkManager's `nmcli` is generally the safer and more integrated approach on systems that use it by default.
