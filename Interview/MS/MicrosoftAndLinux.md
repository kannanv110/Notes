Microsoft's contribution to Linux kernel development has evolved significantly over time. Initially viewed as a competitor, Microsoft has grown to become a notable contributor, driven by its increasing reliance on Linux for its Azure cloud services and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Here's a breakdown of their involvement:

**Early Contributions (Primarily focused on Hyper-V):**

* **Hyper-V Drivers (around 2009):** Microsoft's initial significant contributions involved submitting device drivers to the Linux kernel. These drivers were specifically designed to enhance the performance of Linux as a guest operating system running on Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization technology. This allowed Linux virtual machines on Windows Server to have optimized access to hardware.
* **Enlightenment:** These drivers enabled what Microsoft called "enlightenment," allowing the Linux guest OS to be aware it was virtualized and communicate more efficiently with the underlying Hyper-V hypervisor.

**Growth and Broader Scope:**

* **Linux Foundation Membership:** Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016, signaling a deeper commitment to the open-source ecosystem.
* **WSL Development:** The development of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has necessitated increased interaction with the Linux kernel. WSL 2, in particular, utilizes a genuine, lightweight Linux kernel built by Microsoft, which involves keeping up with and contributing to kernel development.
* **Azure Integration:** With a large percentage of workloads on Microsoft Azure running Linux, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility is crucial. This has led to ongoing contributions related to virtualization, networking, and storage within the Linux kernel to enhance the Azure experience for Linux users.
* **.NET on Linux:** Making the .NET development platform open-source and cross-platform required ensuring its smooth operation on various Linux distributions, which involves some level of interaction with kernel-level functionalities.

**Recent Contributions and Focus:**

* **Azure Linux (CBL-Mariner):** Microsoft developed its own internal Linux distribution, Azure Linux (CBL-Mariner), optimized for container workloads on Azure and its edge services. While this is a separate distribution, its development involves deep engagement with kernel technologies and often includes contributions that could benefit the broader Linux ecosystem.
* **WSLg (GUI Support):** Enabling Linux GUI applications on Windows through WSLg required significant work on kernel-level graphics and display protocols.
* **Inclusive Language:** More recently, Microsoft engineers have contributed patches to the Linux kernel to make its language more inclusive, replacing terms like "master/slave" with "controller/target."
* **Rust for Kernel Development:** Microsoft has been involved in efforts to bring the Rust programming language into the Linux kernel for developing certain types of modules and drivers, contributing to the necessary framework and tooling.

**Key Points to Consider:**

* While Microsoft is a significant contributor, the top contributors to the Linux kernel by the sheer volume of code changes are typically companies like Red Hat, Intel, Google, and individual developers. Microsoft's contributions are often strategic, focusing on areas that directly benefit their products and services, particularly Azure and Windows.
* Microsoft has hired key Linux kernel developers over the years, further demonstrating their commitment to this area.
* Their contributions are not always about fundamentally changing the core of Linux but rather ensuring its smooth and efficient operation within Microsoft's ecosystem and enhancing interoperability with Windows.

In conclusion, Microsoft's journey with the Linux kernel has been transformative. They have moved from being a vocal critic to an active participant and contributor, driven by the practical realities of the modern computing landscape and the widespread adoption of Linux in cloud environments and developer workflows. Their contributions are strategic and growing, making them a relevant player in the ongoing development of the Linux kernel.
